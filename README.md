# runZero API

This repository contains a copy of the runZero OpenAPI Specification (v3) and related files.

Interactive documentation can be found at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/runZero/runZero/

For offline use, we provide a [PDF version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runZeroInc/runzero-api/main/runzero-api.pdf) and a downloadable [zip file with swagger-ui bundled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runZeroInc/runzero-api/main/runzero-api.zip).

The OpenAPI generator can be used to create client stubs for most languages:

The generated stub code in the `go` directory does not relect the current API, and is deprecated.

Please see the [offical documentation](https://www.runzero.com/docs/organization-api/) for additional information.
